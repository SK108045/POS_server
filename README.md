# POS_2 — Multi-Profile Business Point of Sale System

A powerful, lightweight Point of Sale (POS) system built with **Python 3**, **SQLite**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. Designed to support multiple business types from a single unified codebase with zero heavy dependencies or external frameworks.

---

## 🏢 Supported Business Profiles

Enter application PIN `5408`, then choose one of six POS categories. Each category opens directly without a second login:

1. **🛒 Retail / Mini-Mart**: Barcodes, stock inventory, supplier receiving, low-stock & reorder alerts.
2. **💊 Pharmacy**: Batch tracking, expiry countdown & alerts, drug strengths, manufacturer notes.
3. **🍽️ Restaurant / Café**: Table/Tab management, waiter assignment, KOT kitchen printing, dine-in vs takeaway.
4. **🔨 Hardware**: Decimal quantities (e.g. 2.5 kg, 3.2 m), extended units, quotations, wholesale & retail pricing tiers.
5. **👗 Boutique / Cosmetics**: Product variants (sizes, colors, shades) with variant-level stock pickers.
6. **🍸 Bar / Nightclub**: Open tabs, server assignment, nightclub ticket receipts, hospitality flow.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:SK108045/POS_server.git
cd POS_server
```

### 2. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install pillow
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
python3 app.py
```

The application will start at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

To run on a custom port:
```bash
POS_PORT=8080 python3 app.py
```

---

## 🔑 Application access

Run `./start-apk-browser.sh` and open `http://localhost:3000` (or use the Android app).
The browser preview always uses port `3000`, ignoring `PORT` and `POS_PORT` overrides.
If that port is occupied, it reports the conflict instead of switching ports.
Every fresh page load starts with the PIN screen. Enter `5408`, then select Retail,
Pharmacy, Restaurant, Hardware, Boutique, or Bar to open that category's POS directly.
Logout returns to the PIN screen. Existing category catalogs and sales are preserved.
The small **Admin login** link opens the admin password screen; enter `1234`.
Admin uses the last selected category, defaulting to Retail on a new installation.

These are local application access codes. The separate legacy Python interface retains
its existing authentication and is not the launcher described above.

Provider credentials, local databases, and backups are excluded from this repository.
Payment/SMS integrations require local configuration. The UI and local sales work
without provider credentials.

## Android APK architecture

The Android build is offline-first. The Capacitor WebView bundles the POS UI locally and stores operational data on-device using native SQLite (`@capacitor-community/sqlite`) with an IndexedDB fallback for browser testing. Core sales do not require a Python server or internet connection. Network-only integrations such as SMS, cloud sync, remote image search and future M-Pesa integrations should call a remote HTTPS backend so API secrets are never bundled in the APK.

### Single-machine backups (browser preview)

- **Settings → Backup & restore** downloads a versioned JSON export of local database records and shop-selection preferences. The browser uses IndexedDB; the APK bridge uses SQLite. This is a logical data export, not a copy of the separate Flask `data/pos.sqlite3` database.
- Restore replaces all local shops, after validation and confirmation, downloads a safety copy first, and signs out. Close other POS tabs before restoring. Keep backups on a USB drive or another safe location; manual downloads and daily PC backups are local, not cloud backups.
- API key files and image files referenced by URL/path are not embedded in the export. Retain the application files (including uploads) separately. Images stored inside database records remain included.
- This workflow is wired into `capacitor/www` used by `start-apk-browser.sh`. The separate legacy Flask interface is not changed by these features.

### Daily automatic backups on PC

The Node preview server now enables one automatic backup per local calendar day, from either the POS or Admin page. While a page is open, it checks every minute and on window focus. If the application was closed, it catches up on the next opening after shop data is available. It cannot read browser data while the browser is closed.

Files are written atomically to `backups/daily-YYYY-MM-DD.json` in the project root, outside the publicly served web folder and excluded from Git. Existing daily copies are retained; there is no automatic deletion. Restore these files through Settings → Backup & restore. Settings displays the most recent success or a retryable error. Restart `start-apk-browser.sh` after installing this change. The APK does not load this scheduler; automatic mobile backups remain unimplemented.
